## MuRAL

MuRAL is a dataset of activities of daily living in a multi-resident setting, annotated with fine-grained natural language descriptions, resident identities, and high-level activity labels. This dataset was collected in the [Domus intelligent apartment platform](https://www.liglab.fr/en/research/plateforms/domus), in 2025.

This dataset was collected to support future research on multi-resident activity recognition, in particular LLM-powered approaches that can leverage common-knowledge context reasoning to infer activities, using natural language descriptions of the environment and sensors installed in it.

### Download and conditions of use

This dataset is **openly available**, simply contact me by email to ask for access to the dataset. (a download link will be available soon)

## Orange4Home

Orange4Home is a dataset of routines of daily living captured in [Amiqual4Home’s smart home environment](https://amiqual4home.inria.fr/tools/smart-home/), from January 30th, 2017 to February 24th, 2017.

This dataset is the result of a joint work between Orange and Inria. The experiment was conducted by Julien Cumin, Grégoire Lefebvre, Fano Ramparany and James L. Crowley, with technical and organisational help from Nicolas Bonnefond and Stan Borkowski
