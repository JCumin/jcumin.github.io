## Brachylog

Brachylog is a declarative logic programming language much like Prolog. Brachylog is designed to be much terser than Prolog, while retaining some readability.

Brachylog was developped for code golf: solving programming challenges with the smallest possible programs. Brachylog is, as far as I know, the only programming language where constraint logic programming is the default for all integer arithmetic operations.

As a showcase, [here is a 34-character Brachylog program that solves sudokus](https://tio.run/##SypKTM6ozMlPN/r/v9rgUcdyy0edSx@1TH3U1FhT@3DrhEOb9B51LgAyYiDUwx29j5qaoSRIugpIJoNZyRAVQDOAWub8/x8dbaBjomOgYwjEUBirEw2ijXVMoSKGOpZQMQg0A5PGUDFzMA@i1gIsZgE3zRKkFihmCeYZ6cDVA8XMoCqQ7UXoNAK7ygDFXhOI@tjY/1EA):
